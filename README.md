# hello-world
This is my Github repository the I've created while following the Github Flow tutorial
I'm a self-taught software developer who is still in the beginning stages of my education. This Github tutorial should go a long way in teaching me how to share projects I've created and want to work on with others. I have some basic background in HTML and CSS, but would like to cement those skills with some more education and projects that I want to build. I have two web pages that family members would like me to build, those will be some of my first projects that I post on here as well as the learning projects that I've coded on freecodecamp, e.g. the Vigenere cipher that I coded with Python. 
My start date was June 30th, 2024. My goals to complete before the end of the year are: become proficient in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, SQL and React. Develop two to three projects that I can post on Github and add to my portfolio. Complete at least one paid freelance job. Begin, or set a start date for the 100devs bootcamp.
